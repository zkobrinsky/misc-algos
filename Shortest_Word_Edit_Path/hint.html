    <p>What algorithms might be useful for finding a shortest distance?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>We should use a breadth-first search.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Typically in a breadth first search, there is some graph, which for each node has some number of neighbors.  How might you find which words in the word list are neighbors?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>There are two approaches to finding neighbors of a word.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>One approach is for each letter in the original word, change it and check if that word is in the list of words.</li>
    <li>Another approach is for each word in the word list, to check if exactly one letter is different between it and the original word.</li>
    </ul>
